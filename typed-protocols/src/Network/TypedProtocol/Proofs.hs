-- $about
--
-- Typed languages such as Haskell can embed proofs. In total languages this
-- is straightforward: a value inhabiting a type is a proof of the property
-- corresponding to the type.
--
-- In languages like Haskell that have ⊥ as a value of every type, things
-- are slightly more complicated. We have to demonstrate that the value that
-- inhabits the type of interest is not ⊥ which we can do by evaluation.
--
-- This idea crops up frequently in advanced type level programming in Haskell.
-- For example @Refl@ proofs that two types are equal have to have a runtime
-- representation that is evaluated to demonstrate it is not ⊥ before it
-- can be relied upon.
--
-- The proofs here are about the nature of typed protocols in this framework.
-- The 'connect' and 'connectPipelined' proofs rely on a few lemmas about
-- the individual protocol. See 'AgencyProofs'.




-- | The 'connect' function takes two peers that agree on a protocol and runs
-- them in lock step, until (and if) they complete.
--
-- The 'connect' function serves a few purposes.
--
-- * The fact we can define this function at at all proves some minimal
-- sanity property of the typed protocol framework.
--
-- * It demonstrates that all protocols defined in the framework can be run
-- with synchronous communication rather than requiring buffered communication.
--
-- * It is useful for testing peer implementations against each other in a
-- minimalistic setting.

-- | Analogous to 'connectNonPipelined' but also for pipelined peers.
--
-- Since pipelining allows multiple possible interleavings, we provide a
-- @[Bool]@ parameter to control the choices. Each @True@ will trigger picking
-- the first choice in the @SenderCollect@ construct (if possible), leading
-- to more results outstanding. This can also be interpreted as a greater
-- pipeline depth, or more messages in-flight.
--
-- Note that this term proves deadlock freedom of any protocol under the
-- assumption that each side can buffer all messages resulted from pipelining.
-- As a counter example let us consider a 'PingPong' protocol if client side
-- pipelines messages, while the server side is a 'NonPipelined' 'Peer' and
-- consider a communication channel which is implemented using two bounded
-- queues.  If the client will keep sending ping messages it will eventually
-- block not being able to send more, and the remote side will also be
-- eventually blocked not being able to send more replies.  But this can be
-- more subtle than that.  This can happen despite using `CollectSTM`, because
-- it is not an atomic operation to read from the channel.  `CollectSTM` in our
-- current implementation starts a new thread which reads from the network.  We
-- use an stm transaction to wait on its result, however the reading thread can
-- be preempted after reading a message, giving space for the server side
-- to send one more reply, and blocking on sending the next one which can block the
-- client as well (server is not reading), leaving both in a deadlock. This
-- however is only possible when the channels are not prepared to buffer enough
-- messages that result from pipelining.  In protocols which are using system
-- bearers (e.g. TCP), resource consumption resulted from pipelining must be
-- taken into account (which can lead to dropped packets, and thus protocol
-- errors).
--
-- This can be exercised using a QuickCheck style generator.
