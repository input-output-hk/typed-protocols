-- | A description of a peer that engages in a protocol.
--
-- The protocol describes what messages peers /may/ send or /must/ accept.
-- A particular peer implementation decides what to actually do within the
-- constraints of the protocol.
--
-- Peers engage in a protocol in either the client or server role. Of course
-- the client role can only interact with the serve role for the same protocol
-- and vice versa.
--
-- 'Peer' has several type arguments:
--
-- * the protocol itself;
-- * the client\/server role;
-- * whether the peer is using pipelining or not;
-- * the type level queue of future transitions not yet performed due to
--   pipelining;
-- * the current protocol state;
-- * the monad in which the peer operates (e.g. 'IO');
-- * the stm monad, (e.g. 'STM' or it can be left abstract if 'CollectSTM' is
--   not used);
-- * the type of the final result once the peer terminates.
--
-- For example:
--
-- > pingPongClientExample :: Int -> Peer PingPong AsClient    Pipelined Empty StIdle IO STM ()
-- > pingPongServerExample ::        Peer PingPong AsServer NonPipeliend Empty StIdle IO stm Int
--
-- The actions that a non pipelining peer can take are:
--
-- * to perform local monadic effects
-- * to terminate with a result (but only in a terminal protocol state)
-- * to send a message (but only in a protocol state in which we have agency)
-- * to wait to receive a message (but only in a protocol state in which the
--   other peer has agency)
--
-- In addition a pipelining peer can:
--
-- * pipeline a message, which requires upfront declaration at which state we
--   are continue.  This pushes the skipped transition to the back of the
--   pipelining queue.
-- * collect a response, which removes a transition from the front of the
--   queue.  It's worth to notice that this modifies the first element in the
--   queue, in particular it does not changes the queue length.
--   If there's no reply yet, collect allows to either block or continue,
--   possibly pipelining more messages.
-- * collect an identity transition (which removes the first element from the
--   queue).
-- * race between receiving a response and an stm transaction returning
--   a continuation.
--
-- The 'Yield', 'Await', 'Done', 'YieldPipelined', 'Collect', 'CollectDone',
-- 'CollectSTM' constructors require to provide an evidence that the
-- peer has agency in the current state. The types guarantee that it is not
-- possible to supply incorrect evidence,  however you should use
-- 'Network.TypedProtocol.Peer.Client.Client' and
-- 'Network.TypedProtocol.Peer.Client.Server' pattern synonyms which provide
-- this evidence for you.

  --
  -- Note that the continuation that gets supplied with the message must be
